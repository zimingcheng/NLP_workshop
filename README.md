# NLP_workshop

This workshop provided an introduction to using NLP techniques to analyze tweets related to the 2024 US election. Critically, the workshop demonstrated how NLP can be used to automatically quantify the meaning of narratives, providing a powerful tool for psychological research.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing tweet data for analysis.
* Linguistic Feature Analysis: Using lexicons and sentiment analysis tools like Empath and VADER to quantify the emotional tone and valence of tweets.
* Text Vectorization and Embedding: Applying Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to represent tweets as numerical vectors and calculate semantic similarity between them. This was used to investigate which party was viewed with more varied opinions.
* Topic Modeling (if there's time): Using Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify hidden themes and topics within the collection of tweets and exploring their association with different political parties.

**Workshop Highlights:**

* Hands-on experience with popular NLP tools and techniques in Python and R.
* Practical examples of applying NLP to real-world data, specifically tweets related to the 2024 US election.
* Discussion of the limitations of NLP models and how to mitigate them.
* Guidance on interpreting and visualizing the results of NLP analysis.

**Overall Learning Outcomes:**

By the end of the workshop, participants gained a foundational understanding of NLP concepts and techniques, as well as the ability to apply them to analyze text data for extracting meaningful insights. The goal is to demystify NLP to psychologists, and to show that it doesn't take a computer science degree to utilize NLP in their daily research.
